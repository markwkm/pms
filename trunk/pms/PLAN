         3. Notify submitter when patch doesn't build
         4. Status dashboard of patches and build results
         5. Document well

         1. Doesn't manage series of patches well
   3. Features
         1. Delete a patch (actually mark as do not manage anymore.)
         2. Fetch tarball releases from mirrors.
         3. Stop testing patches when it doesn't apply cleanly.
