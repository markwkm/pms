To add a filter, use the script plm_add_filter.pl.  It takes these arguments:

--software <software>

    <software> is the name of the software as listed in the plm_software table
    or as used to add the software to PLM with the plm_add_software.pl script.

    'all' can be used so that a filter applies for all software packages listed
    in PLM.

--name <name>

    <name> is the name of the filter to be added to PLM.

--location <url>

    <url> is the URL the PLM Supervisors will use to wget the the filter.
                        
--command <script>

    <script> is the name of the script that the PLM Supervisors will execute
    when running the filter.

--runtime <seconds>

    <seconds> is the number of seconds that will elapse before PLM will
    assume the script has taken too long to run, assume there is an error, and
    requeue the filter to be execute later.

--filter_type <code>

    <code> is the name of the filter type as listed in the plm_filter_type
    table or the code used too add a filter with the plm_add_filter_type.pl
