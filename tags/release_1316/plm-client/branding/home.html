<h2>Welcome to the Patch Lifecycle Manager</h2>

The <strong>Patch Lifecycle Manager (PLM)</strong> provides a central point for tracking the lifecycle of patches against a source tree.<p>

Regardless of the RCCS system used by the developer to track development of the patch (<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">BitKeeper</a>, or by hand...)  
The PLM can be used as a central publication point. 
This provides a community location for peer review and testing.  
<p>
The required format for a patch is any one supported by the standard 'diff' and 'patch' utilities.
<p>
Metadata about the patch is stored and can be used to save information such as what regression tests the patch has passed or failed.<p>

For a quick introduction to the PLM, please see the <a href="http://www.osdl.org/plm/PLM-HOWTO.html">MINI-HOWTO</a>.<p>
This installation of the PLM is targeted at the <a href="http://www.kernel.org">Linux Kernel</a>.<p>
Once a patch is in this system, you can test it at the <a href="http://www.osdl.org/stp">Scalable Test Platform</a>.<p>

Please send comments to the <a href="mailto:plm-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">developers</a>.<p>
