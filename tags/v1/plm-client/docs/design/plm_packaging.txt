PLM Plan to keep Packaged Kernels for Download (by STP and others)

This is a rather large change in functionality and needs planning.  It can be done in two parts, Add the functionality, then update the web.

New service:
1 Script:  plm_upload_package.pl
     This script tars, compresses and sends files to a downloadable location.
  Update table that tracks existing packages.
  
  Table: plm_package
     Tracks existing packages
        id                      int
        plm_patch_id            int
        plm_package_type_id    int

  Table: plm_patch
     New column to track if packages are present
        plm_package_exists      0,1
        
  Table: plm_package_expire
    This table tracks how long to keep packages for patches.  Duration is in
days.  A '*' would be indefinitely.

        patch_name_match        varchar2(250)

        description             varchar2(250)
        plm_package_script_id   int
        plm_unpackage_script_id int
        
  Table: plm_package_script

        id			int
        name                    varchar2(35)

        script                  glob

  Table:  plm_software_build_depend
     These are packages which the software relies on for dependencies
        id
        plm_software_id
        build_depend

2.  Script:  plm_get_package
        Three parameters
            software_id
            patch_id
            plm_package_name

3.  Cleanup:
    Script to purge out 'plm_package_tracker' table and 
delete packages from the package-repository on a schedule.

4.  Administrative

    * A script to actively purge packages (all or by plm_patch_id)
    * Add delete package to delete patch.

5.  Rewite STP compile filter to compile 4 times, using current kconfig pulled
from CVS, and upload the packages.

6.  A new filter to build a module heavy (generic) kernel for upload.


Web changes:

        If any available?
            Table with names
        Else
