The following information is mostly developer notes.  It's a listing of API
calls at various levels.  The purpose for this is to straighten out the 
dependencies, improve security audit paths and remove cruft.

The call graphs track a call at the user level down to the lowest level.
API calls that are not called by upper level functions are marked as cruft and
not expanded.

There are various levels of API calls, they are as follows
   PLMWeb
   ASP
   PLM
   DB::XML
   DB::Handle
