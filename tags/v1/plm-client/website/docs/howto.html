<h2>USERNAME AND PASSWORD</h2><p>

Your username and password under the PLM are the same as your username and 
password as a OSDL Associate.  If you do not have an Associate account, please
<a href="http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/eidetic.cgi?modulename=users&command=edit">sign up</a> for one.<p>

If you are sure of your Associate username and password but the PLM is refusing
your login, please login to the STP <a href="http://www.osdl.org/stp/">here</a> 
once to verify and sync-up your login with the PLM.  Then try the PLM again and 
if it still fails, please <a href="mailto:support@osdl.org">contact</a> us.<p>

<hr>
<h2>QUICK INFORMATION ON PLAIN TEXT PASSWORDS</h2><p>

You are strongly encouraged to encrypt your patches prior to emailing them.  The
system will handle the decryption before putting the patch into the database.<p>

The Public key for the plm@osdl.org user is available <a href="http://www.osdl.org/projects/plm/plm.gpg">here</a>.  Remember to import the key before attempting to 
use it.<p>

<h2>EMAIL SUBMISSION</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.osdl.org/projects/plm/plmsend.gz">plmsend</a> is a script for the 
auto-submission of patches.  It will handle the encryption and patch metadata 
information for you.<p> 

The first time you run the plmsend script, it will save your setup for future runs.<P>

The email address to have plmsend submit patches to is: plm@osdl.org<p>

The plmsend script can be configured for any of the following mailers: 
<ul>
  <li><strong>mail</strong> - Standard local SMTP configuration (sendmail/exim)
  <li><strong>mutt</strong> - Use the mutt program to send via external SMTP
  <li><strong>file</strong> - Save the patch in a file for submission manualy
</ul>

If you output to file, email your patch file (with the metadata included) to plm@osdl.org<p>

<hr>
<h2>PLMSEND SYNTAX</h2><p>

To submit a patch, you will need to have the following information:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Applies</strong> - You need to know the patch name that your patch applies to (as registered in the PLM database).  For regular mainline Linux Kernel patches, the naming looks /exactly/ like the file on kernel.org. (example:  linux-2.4.18  or  patch-2.4.19-pre2)
  <li><strong>Name</strong> - Your patch needs a name - include the version in the string.
  <li><strong>Filename</strong> - The name of your file on disk.  If you can't find this, we can't help you.
</ul>
Syntax for the plmsend command is:<p>

<pre>
	plmsend [applies] [name] [filename]
</pre>

Example plmsend submission line:<p>

<pre>
	$ plmsend linux-2.4.18 2.4.18-rawio-2 2.4.18-rawio-2.patch
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>PATCH SUBMISSION</h2><p>

You will get an email in response telling you the PLM ID of the accepted patch 
or telling you what went wrong with your submission.  If you don't get any 
email back at all, that means you don't have an account.  We don't respond to 
invalid account emails to avoid being triggered by SPAM.  In the future if you 
attempt to login with a '#plm login' command and your login fails, we will 
email you to let you know.<p>

If you have any questions about errors you receive or believe you do have an 
account and are not getting responses, please email <a href="mailto:support@osdl.org">support@osdl.org</a> and let us know.
