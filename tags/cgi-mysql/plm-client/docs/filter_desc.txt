The filters being run in PLM fall into several categories:

1.  Apply Patch:  This simply tests that all sources are available and 
    patches apply without error.

2.  Default compiles:  These are compiles that are as close as possible to the 'defconfig'.

        This is done for various architectures:
             PPC-Cross Compile 40x
             Alpha Cross Compile
             Sparc64 Cross Compile
             Sparc Cross Compile
             PPC64 Cross Compile
             x86_64 Cross Compile
             ia32 Default Compile

3.  Compregress:
        Run a series of compiles:  defconfig, allmodconfig, allyesconfig, allnoconfig
        Then compile all the code in directories: fs drivers/video drivers/scsi drivers/net

        This is run on several architectures:  
             ia32 Compile Regress, 
             PPC-Cross Compile Regress, 
             ia64-Cross Compile Regress 

4.  STP configs:  
    ia32 STP Compile:  Does two compiles with the 1CPU and 4CPU configurations for STP.
                       ( This filter is mostly for internal use. )

5.  ia32 Max Compile Count:  This uses a very large configuratiov which Linus Torvalds has provided 
    kernel developers as a minimum to test code breakage.


For all filters with counts of errors and warnings, the compile is run
with an option to continue even if an error occurs.  Exact duplicate
errors and warnings are counted as only one.
