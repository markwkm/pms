README for the Patch Lifecycle Manager

The PLM is *not* a SCCS system in traditional sense (aka, CVS, SCCS, 
BitKeeper).  Instead the PLM allows a developer to submit a patch 
against another patch or baseline version.  The patch is then 
tracked and may become a base point for further development.  Meta
data about the patch such as filter test results is kept.

The PLM was written by Nathan Dabney at the Open Source Development Lab
for the purpose of maintaining a central repository of submitted patches 
against the Linux kernel.  Testing filters exist for verifying a patch 
applies against the Linux kernel correctly and for numerous compile 
configurations.

In the future we hope to add ability to handle generic software and the
various type of places they come from, bug reporting, tracking and more advanced 
testing to the PLM as well as a more flexible command line client that 
makes use of the web interface for administrative functions.
