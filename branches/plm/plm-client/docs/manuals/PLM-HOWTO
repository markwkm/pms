'plmsend' is a script for auto-submission of patches.  It will handle the 
encryption and patch metadata information for you.

After downloading the plmsend script, you will want to create a ~/.plmrc file.
The format of this file is as follows:

VARIABLE=VALUE where VARIABLE can be any of:
  USER - For your username on the PLM system
  PASS - For your account (make sure the file is readable only by you if
         you include this)
  PLM_TO_ADDR - The email address to submit patches to.  Set this to
                PLM_TO_ADDR=plm@osdl.org
  (the following options are optional)
  ENCRYPT - Encryption is on by default, to disable it, set this to 'off'
  MAILER - Tell the script to use either 'mail' or 'mutt' to compose the email
  SANITY - If you don't want to hit enter to confirm a submission, set:
           SANITY=gone
  
After you have a valid ~/.plmrc file and have a patch ready, remember you need
to have the following information:

  Applies - You need to know the patch name that your patch applies to (as
            registered in the PLM database).  For regular mainline Linux Kernel
	    patches, the naming looks /exactly/ like the file on kernel.org
	    example:  linux-2.4.18  or  patch-2.4.19-pre2
  Name - Your patch needs a name - include the version in the string.
  Filename - The name of your file on disk.  If you can't find this, I can't
             help you.

Syntax for the plmsend command is:

plmsend <applies> <name> <filename>

Example plmsend submission line:

$ plmsend linux-2.4.18 2.4.18-rawio-2 2.4.18-rawio-2.patch
  
  
-PATCH METADATA-

If you use the plmsend script, you do NOT NEED to understand this section.

Actions on patchs sent in to the PLM are determined by metadata tags included at
the top of the patch in comments. To use a metadata tag, put it at the start of
the patch in the following form: 
	
	#plm [metadata-tag] [options...]

Each patch has metadata parameters, some are required and some are optional.  
Metadata is included as comments to the patch, for example:

contents of kernel.patch:
 #plm login example-username example-password 
 #plm name 2.4.18-rc2 
 #plm applies linux-2.4.17
 diff -Naur -X /home/marcelo/lib/dontdiff linux.orig/CREDITS linux/CREDITS

The diff line is the start of the actual patch and the #plm lines will be 
stripped before the patch is saved.

The required lines are:
 login [username] [password]
 name "string name for patch"
 applies "name of the patch or regular version this applies to"

The standard names will appear *exactly* as the filenames on ftp.kernel.org 
appear but without the .tar.bz2 (i.e. applies linux-2.4.18)

There are various optional parameters in development.  This section will be 
updated when they become available.

!!!Don't forget the #plm!!!

-PATCH SUBMISSION-

Email your patch file (with the metadata included) to plm@osdl.org

You will get an email in response telling you the PLM ID of the accepted patch 
or telling you what went wrong with your submission.  If you don't get any 
email back at all, that means you don't have an account.  We don't respond to 
invalid account emails to avoid being triggered by SPAM.  In the future if you 
attempt to login with a '#plm login' command and your login fails, we will 
email you to let you know.
