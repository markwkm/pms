Title:    Convert PLM MySQL database to PostgresSQL

Contents:
* plm_dump.sh
* plm_export.sh
* plm_import_pgsql
* plm_import_to_pgsql.pl
* plm_import_patches.pl

Dependencies:
DBI
DBD:Pg
postgres-dev
mysql client
psql client
perl
bzip2

Directions:
Edit plm_export.sh script to match usernames, databases and passwords for both databases and the path for the
patch files. Be prepared to enter passwords manually for both postgres database and to download the patch files.
Importing the path files is by default commented out in plm_export.sh, uncomment to use and make sure you have the
dependencies.

NOTE: depending on database size and the amount of patch files these scripts could require a lot of space!!!
      ( like 10 Gig, it will take a while too, go get yourself a coffee. )

Then run:
./plm_export.sh

View run.err and run.out to determine if there were any errors.
