* Create shell script for adding software
* Create shell script for adding sources
* Create library for fetching sources
	-- verify source once it is on disk
	-- pull latest tarballs (or whatever) from defined URLs
	-- md5sum check (LOW PRIORITY)
* Create library for adding 'filters' (probably will rename -- maybe to 'actions')
	-- Establish default set of actions (unpack, apply patches, configure, make, test)
	-- Create filters for patches applied to sources
