===============================================================================

Q1:	I am using pine for email and patches I know apply cleanly localy don't 
apply when taken from the PLM database.

A1:	Pine munges whitespace.  Try a different mailer or upgrade pine to a 
version that works.

Q2:	Do I have to have a working email program to submit patches using the 
'plmsend' script?

A2:	Yes.  Not just any email program either, it must be a email program 
that provides a working 'mail' command to your system.  In other words, you 
need sendmail, qmail, exim, postfix or a similar program.  If you don't want
to setup a program like that, you need to setup one that plmsend understands 
how to use.  Currently that list is limited to 'mutt'.

Q3:	What file formats does the web interface support?

A3:	plain patch, bzip2 and gzip - bzip2 is the suggested format

-----

Q4:	Do I need the PLM package to submit patches?

A4:	No.  The PLM site should have a easy to use web interface available
	The web interface address for the PLM install at the OSDL is:

		http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm

	The plmsend script is also a handy way to submit patches through email.
