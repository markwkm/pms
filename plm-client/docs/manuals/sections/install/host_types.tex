\section {PLM Host Types}

\index{Admin!HostType}
PLM will usually be installed on several machines which can generally be classified by functionality.

\begin{itemize}
\item Web Server:  Provide access to the patches, and database through ASP functions.
\item Simple Client: Provide access to patches
\item Supervisor Client: Processes filters for the patches
\item Administrative Client: Run various administrative scripts
\end{itemize}

Some of the hosts may serve more than one purpose.  They should be configured according only to their purpose, or the configuration file will get confusing, as well as contain more sensitive information than necessary.
