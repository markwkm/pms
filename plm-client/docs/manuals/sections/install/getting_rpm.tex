We currently make the tarball sources available.  This includes a script called lsb\_package.sh which when run will generate a RedHat rpm, tested on 8.  The spec file, 'lsb-rpm.spec', is in the top directory.  Or you can download the rpm we generate at the URL listed below, but it places the items in set locations. 

If you would like to assist us with providing build patches for other targets, please feel free to contribute.
